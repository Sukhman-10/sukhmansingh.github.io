🔍 Selected Projects

Here are three standout projects demonstrating my analytical toolkit and business-impact focus:

1. NHS Operational Analysis
6

A deep dive into operational data for the National Health Service (NHS). I analysed waiting-times, resource allocation, hospital performance metrics, and patient flow to help identify bottlenecks and optimise healthcare delivery.

2. Pizza Sales Dashboard
6

I built an interactive dashboard analysing pizza orders by day, hour, category and size. The dashboard reveals revenue trends, busiest time-slots, top-selling categories and helps the business optimise operations and menu/pricing strategy.

3. Superstore Sales Analysis
6

Using the “Superstore” dataset, I applied statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA), factor analysis and clustering to segment customers and identify sales drivers. Then visualised results via dashboards to support strategic decision-making in retail.
